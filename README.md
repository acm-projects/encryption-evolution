# encryption-evolution
2D game that teaches people the evolution of encryption, from simple ciphers to modern encryption algorithms

## MVP
- A starting main menu with selectable levels
- At least 3 interactive levels:
  - Levels center around progressively harder and more complex ciphers
  - Guides players on each step of encoding a message using different algorithms / ciphers
  - Allows players to decrypt a reply
- A glossary of important vocabulary is included (ie. definitions of cipher, encode, hash, key, etc)

## Stretch Goals
- Levels incorporate history and story elements in order to become more fleshed out and immersive
- Improved graphics and animation
- Practice modes allowing players to use the same ciphers they were taught but with new messages to encrypt/decrypt and no/less guidance
  - Unlockable after completion of relevant level
- Enable account creation and authorization
  - Able to save progress and unlock levels
- Add more levels (although I'd prefer quality over quantity)

### Suggestions
- Use [Godot Game Maker](https://godotengine.org/) + GitHub
  - Open source (extendable through C++), built-in IDE, cross platform (including 3DS!), reportedly easy version control with Git, language: GDScript which is similar to Python or you can use C++, light-weight
  - Tutorials:
    - [Official Godot Documentation : Getting Started](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html)
    - [Godot Engine 3 - Platform Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wETY5_9kFtA) 
- However, feel free to look around at other game engines
  - [Cocos2DX](https://cocos2d-x.org/)
    - Open source, cross platform, language: Lua, lots of 3rd party assets
  - [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/)
    - Cross platform, language: Lua, use your own text editor, active community
  - Thoughts on Unity or GameMaker: 
    - more complex than necessary for a 2D game
    - more drag and drop than programming
    - difficult with version control
