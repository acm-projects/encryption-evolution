# encryption-evolution
2D game that teaches people the evolution of encryption, from simple ciphers to modern encryption algorithms!

## MVP
- A starting main menu with selectable levels
- At least 3 interactive levels:
  - Levels center around progressively harder and more complex ciphers
  - Guides players on each step of encoding a message using different algorithms / ciphers
  - Allows players to decrypt a reply
- A glossary of important vocabulary is included (ie. definitions of cipher, encode, hash, key, etc)

## Stretch Goals
- Levels incorporate history and story elements in order to become more fleshed out and immersive
- Improved graphics and animation
- Practice modes allowing players to use the same ciphers they were taught but with new messages to encrypt/decrypt and no/less guidance
  - Unlockable after completion of relevant level
- Enable account creation and authorization
  - Able to save progress and unlock levels
- Add more levels (although I'd prefer quality over quantity)

- [Git Bash for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)
  - Mac users can just use the console
  - [Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- Cyptography:
  - [Cipher Options](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/)
    - A good website with a lot of ciphers, an introduction to each, and their algorithms.
  - [Alt. Cipher Website](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/)
    - Alternate cipher website
  - [Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm](https://exceptionnotfound.net/understanding-the-fisher-yates-card-shuffling-algorithm/)
    - An extra option not included in the above website.
  - [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o&vl=en)
    - Intro to cyptography feat. CrashCourse on youtube. Also, a good example on how to teach others about cryptography and ciphers.
  - [Coursera: Cryptography](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto?action=enroll)
    - Free course that officially starts after Sept. 30, but I'm pretty sure you can view all the material right now. A little late to be useful, but maybe for future reference if you want to continue learning more about cryptography on your own.
- Free 2D Assets

### Suggestions
- Use [Godot Game Maker](https://godotengine.org/) + GitHub
  - Open source (extendable through C++), built-in IDE, cross platform (including 3DS!), reportedly easy version control with Git, language: GDScript which is similar to Python or you can use C++, light-weight
  - Tutorials:
    - [Official Godot Documentation : Getting Started](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html)
    - [Programming in GDScript Intro](https://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Godot-3-Tutorial-GDScript-Programming-101.aspx)
    - [Godot Engine 3 - Platform Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wETY5_9kFtA) 
      - A tutorial on how to create a simple 2D platformer starting at the first time you open Godot. Good for learning how to navigate the environment.
- However, feel free to look around at other game engines
  - [Cocos2DX](https://cocos2d-x.org/)
    - Open source, cross platform, language: Lua, lots of 3rd party assets
    - [Starter Pack](https://cocos2d-x.org/learn)
  - [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/)
    - Cross platform, language: Lua, use your own text editor, active community

  - Thoughts on Unity or GameMaker: 
    - more complex than necessary for a 2D game
    - more drag and drop than programming
    - difficult with version control
