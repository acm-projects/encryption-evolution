# encryption-evolution
2D game that teaches people the evolution of encryption, from simple ciphers to modern encryption algorithms

## MVP
- A main menu with level selection
- At least 3 interactive levels 
- Levels center around progressively harder and more complex ciphers
- Guides players on each step of encoding a message using different algorithms / ciphers
- Allows players to decrypt a reply
- A glossary of important vocabulary is included (ie. definitions of cipher, encode, hash, key, etc)

## Stretch Goals
- Levels incorporate history and story elements
- Improved graphics + animation
- Practice modes
- Able to save progress and unlock levels
- Add more levels (although I'd prefer quality over quantity)

## Resources
- [Git Bash for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)
- [Cipher Options](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/)
- 2D Assets 
  - [GameDeveloperStudio](https://www.gamedeveloperstudio.com/index.php)
  - [Itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-2d)

## Suggestions
- Use [Godot Game Maker](https://godotengine.org/) + GitHub
  - Open source (extendable through C++), built-in IDE, cross platform (including 3DS!), reportedly easy version control with Git, language: GDScript which is similar to Python or you can use C++, light-weight
- However, feel free to look around at other game engines
  - [Cocos2DX](https://cocos2d-x.org/)
    - Open source, cross platform, language: Lua, lots of 3rd party assets
  - [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/)
    - Cross platform, language: Lua, use your own text editor, active community
  - Thoughts on Unity or GameMaker: 
    - more complex than necessary for a 2D game
    - more drag and drop than programming
    - difficult with version control
